title: I don't really know much tbh

Inspired by [Dan Abramov's honest thoughts](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/) regarding his own expertise, I'd like to dispel any personal delusions in my own understanding of the vast realm of software. 

Truth be told, I'm constantly fluttering between new technology, hoping to sink my teeth into something that can perhaps sustain my career - whether that's a certain JS framework, blockchain, Rust, Go, Node, Flutter, serverless, Python, whatever other computing language or tool, oh yah and GraphQL. But because my experience with each technology is so touch and go, I hardly ever master anything, let alone ingest enough to be useful. 

There's alot to be said about different forms of learning, but my point is that I have this incessant need to find a niche. However, istead of searching, it's time to learn to focus my energy and attention on singular topics. Focus itself is a mental exercise - a trained ability that I may never have had.

So here goes my honest admissions: 

I don't know React as well as I think I do. I still have so much trouble managing my states! I constantly have to look up old code to re-teach myself basic patterns.

I do too many tutorials. I fast-forward through Egghead and Front End Master courses in hopes of having things stick. 

I make too many 'study' todo items that I insist I have to complete. This is a rather exhaustingly hampering noose on my ability to truly, mentally, relax.

I still forget how to do basic CSS layout. How fast things deterioriate when you don't practice.

I get stuck configuring my tools more often than writing product code.

I choke down too many software engineering podcasts that I don't leave room to enjoy my music and fun podcasts. I mean, I really enjoy my technical podcasts! But it's the moments when I want to listen more leisurely, I don't allow myself that.

I freakin cannot solve algorithms well at all. Cheers to hoping this year of leetcode and my red book can make a dent in my brain.

I dream of doing open source more than actually doing open source. Aka, browsing github code and feed is my IG scrolling time.

So where do I go from here? Lately a motto that I've been finding very useful is __"do just-in-time learning, not just-in-case learning.__" As a general rule of thumb, I think I'll multiply any expected learning time by a factor of 3-5. If, say, a tutorial on Go hovers around 3hr, I'll make sure I invest at least 9hrs total to truly let my brain grok the knowledge.
