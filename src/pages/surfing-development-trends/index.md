I agonize quite often over new technology. I certainly know why and where that comes from, and any certain senior developer that's been in the game for a while can understand. It's just as an early engineer, you can get trapped in decision paralysis. Am I choosing the right technology/language to learn? Do I dive deeper into node? Dive into infrastructure? Do I learn rust? What about blockchain stuff? 

TLDR: Balance between lightly trying new things, master *one* thing. 

Fortunately I'm finally coming to understand the overarching picture. It's about having principles, knowing the end goal. Keeping *tabs* on trends is enough. Thus my latest writing is my first attempt at sharpening my focus.
